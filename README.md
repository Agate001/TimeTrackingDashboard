// Person who Peer Reviewed your assignment - Gavin: looks almost perfect to the prototype there are just some very minor flaws in the UI
and some responsiveness like when im mobile version the "Last Week" Time Tracker that goes below the current Time it doesnt show on the right next to the time when in mobile
and another very small issue is how the background image that goes behind each activity card tracker its just showing on the bottom of the cards very slightly and one more 
small thing is your left nav bar with the profile picture the lighter blue section needs a little more margin going down and I would recemmend putting the hover effect over your ellipsis " . . .", aside from those 3 things everything loosk great!
